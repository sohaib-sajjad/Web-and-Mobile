# Event Manager (Flutter)

Simple event management Flutter app with a Host side (create/manage events) and an Attendee side (browse/register).

Quick start

1. Ensure Flutter is installed and on your PATH: `flutter --version`
2. From the project folder run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes
- The app uses `shared_preferences` to persist events and registrations locally.
- This is a minimal scaffold — feel free to extend authentication, server sync, and UI polish.
